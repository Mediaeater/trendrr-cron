Some additions and enhancements made to cron4j (http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/cron4j/), a cron-like scheduler for Java. Contributions include methods to find next matching date for a scheduling pattern

Note: This currently depends on some internal code and will not build. We are working to resolve that
